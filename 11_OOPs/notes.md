# javascript and classes 
technically there is no classes 
JavaScript does have classes! Although JavaScript is primarily a prototype-based language, it also supports class-based inheritance through the ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) specification1. Classes in JavaScript are mainly an abstraction over the existing prototypical inheritance mechanism, and all patterns are convertible to prototype-based inheritance. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data, making it easier to create objects with similar properties and behaviors23. So, you can indeed use classes in JavaScript, even though itâ€™s not a purely class-based language like Java or C#.

## OOP (object oriented programming)

## object 
- a collection of properties and methods
- properties are variables that belong to an object
- methods are functions that belong to an object
- objects are created using the new keyword
- toLowerCase

## why use OOP
- to create reusable code
- to create code that is easy to maintain
- to create code that is easy to read and understand

## parts of OOP
object literal

-Constructor function
-prototypes
-classes
-Instances(new,this)


## 4 Pillars
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
